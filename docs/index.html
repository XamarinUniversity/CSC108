      <h2>Before you begin</h2>
      <p>
         This is a Xamarin cross-platform class about C#. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin development environment (Mac or Windows) to run the exercise on. Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
      </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this course, you will get experience with the debugging process. You will set breakpoints so you can stop in the middle of execution
            to examine values and look at the call stack. You will use Watch Statements to track the values of your variables during a run of your app. 
            Finally, you will learn to distinguish between exceptions and errors and use try/catch statements around potential exceptions.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Explain and illustrate the importance of debugging</li>
            <li>Discover how to throw and catch exceptions</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>
            Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/CSC108/">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/CSC108/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div class="objective">Set breakpoints and inspect values</div>
                <a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
                <br />
                In this exercise, you will set breakpoints to tell the debugger to stop program execution at a set line. 
                You will use the locals, watch, and call-stack windows to examine the state of your app while it is paused.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="objective">Throw, catch, and handle an exception</div>
                <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
                <br />
                Here you will use an exception to indicate that a problem occurred during execution.
                You will throw an exception at the point you detect the fault and catch it in a different part of your code.
            </li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Homework</h2>
      <p>
         <a href="./parts/homework.html">Homework</a>
         <br />
         This optional homework exercise will help to cement the topics in this class by having you write a fun number guessing game.
